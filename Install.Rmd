#Install Rmarkdown

This tutorial has been made with Rmarkdown. We only have to write the text below to install the package:

```{r}
install.packages("rmarkdown")

```

To render file, weÂ´ll use:

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("file_to_render.Rmd")

```

If you are using rmarkdown::render then you can pass a format name to render to select from the available formats. For example:

```{r}
render("file_to_render.Rmd", "pdf_document")
```
